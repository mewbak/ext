# [ZikiChombo](http://zikichombo.org) ext

The ext repository houses code collaborations which require imports of zikichombo.org and 
collaborators.

Unlike all other zikichombo modules, the code here may depend on 3rd party licenses for imports
aside from the Go standard library or host operating system.  As such, verification of licensing 
compatibility and liability is up to consumers of ext.  We prefer delivering a simpler licensing 
solution, as is the case in all the other repositories. But sometimes the easiest way to collaborate
may be to drop the concerns over import direction between the developers, at the cost of consumer
licensing complexity. ext provides a place to do that.
